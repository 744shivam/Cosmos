<hr/>

Cosmos (C# Open Source Managed Operating System) is an operating system development kit which uses dotnet, along with the custom il2cpu compiler to turn any C# code into a working bare-metal OS.
Despite C# in the name, any .NET based language can be used including VB.NET, Fortran, Delphi Prism, IronPython, F# and more. Cosmos itself and the kernel routines are primarily written in C#, and thus the Cosmos name.

In a project, cosmos can be thought of as a compiler and a sort-of standard library for a project. It gives the user access to often hard to find or otherwise difficult to understand tools.

## Some of the included features

These are some of the (optinal) features that can be used in cosmos:

|                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------|
| Low level assembly access and pointer memory control |
| A basic (and unstable at the moment) filesystem      |
| Most fretures found in the .NET corlib               |
| A CPU/FPU accelerated math library                   |
| A basic graphics interface                           |
| A basic network interface                            |
| A basic audio interface                              |
> Note: Use [embeded resources](https://cosmosos.github.io/articles/Kernel/ManifestResouceStream.html) instead of the FS for now.
